# plic - a tiny, minimal LISP interpreter written in Rust

## Overview

plic is a minimal implementation of a LISP-like language sharing a lot of its
design with Scheme.

It is not intended to be widely useful, and is purely intended as an exercise
for myself to understand the mechanisms for evaluating functional expressions
and experiment around language design. Oh and to learn Rust as well!
